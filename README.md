# Boilerplate

## Installation
- Clone repository
- `npm i` in your favourite Terminal/Command Prompt
- Go and make a brew while dependencies install

## Issues
- When installing on Windows, an error appears [_Unsupported platform for fsevents@1.0.14: wanted {"os":"darwin","arch":"any"} (current: {"os":"win32","arch":"x64"})_](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/13935). Suggested solution is to use `npm i -f` to `--force` the Installation.
